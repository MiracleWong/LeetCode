# LeetCode
My LeetCode Journey

I join the "Algorithm Online Class in April" which is created by [七月算法](www.julyedu.com)

I can understand the class when teachers teaching in the classes , but I cannot code correctly in the [LeetCode](www.LeetCode.com), my code is always not AC.

I create this resposity ioto start "My LeetCode Journey", and code and solve the problems in Java.

If you quick glance at this resposity and you like it , please star it , I will appreciate it for your encourage!
